# IRDump library for Arduino

The IRDump library provides utility functions for sending and receiving
infrared pulses, using this library you can sniff some signals sent by infrared
remote controllers and craft your own signals too!

## Usage

```c++
class IRDump {
public:
  IRDump();

  // Match returns true if the given signal `b` matches `a`. A `threshold`
  // defined the error tolerance for each element of `a` and `b`.
  bool Match(unsigned int *a, unsigned int *b, int threshold);

  // Capture reads data from the IR sensor given by `pin` and writes it to the
  // `signal` array. The user must define the maximum number of pulses this
  // signal will have (`maxPulses`) and the maximun lenght of each pulse
  // (`pulseMaxLength`) in milliseconds.
  bool Capture(int pin, unsigned int *signal, int maxPulses, int pulseMaxLength);

  // Emit sends a signal using the IR LED given by `pin` at a custom frequency
  // (`kHz`).
  void Emit(int pin, unsigned int *signal, int kHz);
};
```

## How to install

Create new a folder named `MakerWorkshop` within the Arduino's library folder.
If you're on a Mac it should be `Documents/Arduino/libraries/` on Linux it
probably would be in `/usr/share/arduino/libraries/`. If that folder already
exists you don't need to create it again.

Download and uncompress the latest [.ZIP package][1], a folder named
`arduino_irdump-master` will be created, rename the uncompressed folder to
`arduino_irdump` and put it into your recently created `MakerWorkshop` folder.

That's all! this library should be ready to use in your projects now. See the
Arduino's documentation on [importing libraries][2] whenever you're in doubt.
