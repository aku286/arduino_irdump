# IRDump library for Arduino

The IRDump library provides utility functions for sending and receiving
infrared pulses, using this library you can sniff some signals sent by infrared
remote controllers and craft your own signals too!

## Usage

```c++
class IRDump {
public:
  IRDump();

  // Match returns true if the given signal `b` matches `a`. A `threshold`
  // defined the error tolerance for each element of `a` and `b`.
  bool Match(unsigned int *a, unsigned int *b, int threshold);

  // Capture reads data from the IR sensor given by `pin` and writes it to the
  // `signal` array. The user must define the maximum number of pulses this
  // signal will have (`maxPulses`) and the maximun lenght of each pulse
  // (`pulseMaxLength`) in milliseconds.
  bool Capture(int pin, unsigned int *signal, int maxPulses, int pulseMaxLength);

  // Emit sends a signal using the IR LED given by `pin` at a custom frequency
  // (`kHz`).
  void Emit(int pin, unsigned int *signal, int kHz);
};
```

## Example project

See [arduino_irdump_example][3] for a fully working example project.

## How to install

1. Download the latest [.ZIP package][1].
1. From the *Sketch* > *Include Library* menu of the Arduino IDE choose *Add
   .ZIP Library...*.
1. Browse for the .ZIP file you've just downloaded.
1. After the installation, you'll be able to include the header's library
   easily from the *Sketch* > *Include Library* menu, just look for the new
   *IRDump* action under *Contributed libraries*.

## Acknowledgements

I went through these sources while learning how IR sensors and emitters work:

The code used for emitting signals was taken from the
[Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote) library, with
some minor modifications.
