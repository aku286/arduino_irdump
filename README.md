# IRDump library for Arduino

The IRDump library provides utility functions for sending and receiving
infrared pulses, using this library you can sniff some signals sent by infrared
remote controllers and craft your own signals too!

## Usage

```c++
class IRDump {
public:
  IRDump();

  // Match returns true if the given signal `b` matches `a`. A `threshold`
  // defined the error tolerance for each element of `a` and `b`.
  bool Match(unsigned int *a, unsigned int *b, int threshold);

  // Capture reads data from the IR sensor given by `pin` and writes it to the
  // `signal` array. The user must define the maximum number of pulses this
  // signal will have (`maxPulses`) and the maximun lenght of each pulse
  // (`pulseMaxLength`) in milliseconds.
  bool Capture(int pin, unsigned int *signal, int maxPulses, int pulseMaxLength);

  // Emit sends a signal using the IR LED given by `pin` at a custom frequency
  // (`kHz`).
  void Emit(int pin, unsigned int *signal, int kHz);
};
```

## Example projects

* [CaptureAndReplay][3] shows how to intercept and replay IR signals.
* [Arduino Hexbug Spider](https://github.com/xiam/arduino_hexbug_spider) shows
  how to control an Hexbug Spider with Arduino and an IR LED.

## How to install

Download the latest [.ZIP package][1] and follow the official instructions on
[importing a .ZIP library][2].

If you're planning to hack on this library you can also clone this repo
directly into your Arduino's library directory:

```
cd ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
git clone https://github.com/xiam/arduino_hexbug_spider.git
```

You can find this path on the Preferences dialog of Arduino IDE.

## Acknowledgements

I went through these sources while learning how IR sensors and emitters work:

The code used for emitting signals was taken from the
[Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote) library, with
some minor modifications.
